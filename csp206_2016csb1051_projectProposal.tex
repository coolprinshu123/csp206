\section{Idea}
We are going to make an android application which will search for a particular type of food in the location. 
\section{Description}
The app will take a particular type of food as input and it will search in its database for that particular type of food and give the result.The app will be using GPS to get the current location.However you can also search for other location.Once the input is given the app will show the restaurants nearby that area who serves that particular food.It will also show the distance from your current location and also there will be the navigation facility to go to that place.For navigation we will be redirecting the app to google maps.The app will also show the users rating and their comments.You can sort the list according to any of the parameters i.e user's ratings,price,distance from your current location.It will also have the facility to register for the restaurant where people can register for their restaurants.
